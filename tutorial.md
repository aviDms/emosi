# VueJS Tutorial

## Introduction
### Declarative Rendering
  * Vue binds **data** to HTML and re-renders it every time the **data** changes. It can bind to:
    * text
    * element's attributes - using a directive such as **v-bind**
    * structure of the DOM - using directives such as **v-if** and **v-for**
  * Vue can also attach methods to event listeners by using the **v-on** directive
  * Input elements can be two-way binded to the state using the **v-model** directive
